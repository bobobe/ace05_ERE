  "Sentence" : "tariq aziz 's sun ziad looks worried. he 's willing to talk with us , but not be interviewed. as he explains how his father negotiated his surrender. he says his father 's night-time handover was dignified , that u . s. forces offered medical support for his father 's heart condition , that has caused two heart attacks recently. they do n't know when to expect him back , and have been told he faces lots of questions. outside , u . s. troops provide occasional protection. nearby , a neighbor hopes all will be well. another neighbor comes to our car to give his opinion. he was a normal person , he says. a good neighbor , but a bad politician. at their nearby store , they prepare to open for their first day of business since the war. aziz was a politician he said. it 's saddam and the others americans have problems with. maybe he gives us information about the missing people , and perhaps saddam hussein. further down the road , these men wait for a ride. neither have anything bad to say about aziz. we call him mr. aziz , and i 'm proud of him , says this former traffic cop. he was cultured , and i wish someone like him rules us. his friend adds , if all the leaders stayed in baghdad , then the americans will catch them. across town in a less affluent neighborhood , reactions to aziz 's arrest are profoundly different. i did n't hear about it , explains this man , because we did n't have electricity. when we explained the news to the crowd , a bystander steps forward. america is playing a trick on us he says. where is our government and our security ?",
