  "Sentence" : "bombardment of baghdad continues tonight and over the past 20 minutes , explosions rocking baghdad , central baghdad southern baghdad , the outskirts of baghdad , and importantly , as the coalition forces , principally u . s. army forces , move against saddam hussein international airport -- which is about ten miles outside the center of baghdad -- those explosions are intensifies. if we may again going to the wide screen of what appears to me to be abu dhabi television that is providing this picture , 3:20 a . m. in baghdad , live pictures again. that it is very difficult to discern whether or not that is , in point of fact , the missiles that we have become accustomed to striking baghdad and its environs , or whether it is the large 2,000 pound jdam bombs that have been striking targets sclected by the coalition in baghdad , or whether these flashes now represent artillery barrages as fighting continues to take control of the -- to take control of saddam international airport. again , correspondents , our correspondents with the -- embedded with these forces , with them in the field , saying in some cases they can see the lights of the skyline of baghdad. over the course of the past two weeks , since this war began , something like 23,000 coalition sorties have been flown , and over the course of the past 24 hours , 1,900 sorties flown. and we are told that , of those , 850 were strike sorties , motor vehicle most of those directed against the republican guard. as you know , the republican guard just outside baghdad to defend the city and saddam hussein's regime , in principal. two of those divisions absolutely devastated , destroyed. the so-called medina division , and the baghdad division. the baghdad division , of course , getting its name from the fact that it is the republican guard division designated to defend principally baghdad. four other divisions we are told have also been hit very , very very hard and are principally trying to reinforce units va also been hit very hard. so we are seeing a lot of what some of the military officials are calling a method that does not seem to be directed by one person from the center of baghdad. and that raises questions , questions that have been in front of us since that first strike on march 19th against the location that the cia military intelligence thought was a place where saddam hussein , perhaps his sons , were. that preemptive strike they put , i think somewhat elegantly , trying to strike at the head of the snake. new explosions rocking parts of baghdad tonight. we will continue to monitor that. we , of course , will bring the word to you just as soon as the army and coalition forces do take control of saddam hussein international airport , just on the outskirts of baghdad. in southern iraq today , british forces also moving closer to the center of the second largest city in iraq , basra. they captured an iraqi base in an unused factory in the southern suburbs of that city. tim hewart of itn reports .",
