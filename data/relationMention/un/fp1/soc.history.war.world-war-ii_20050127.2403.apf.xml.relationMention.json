I've read quite a few more rational works describing how the US was doing its best to avoid, or at the very least postpone, a war against Japan, mainly because FDR was trying to provoke Hitler to war and didn't need a distraction on another distant front.        work?  (stuff deleted)  The thesis has been expounded by several conspiracy theorists, mainly the ones who expounded that FDR knew Pearl Harbor was about to be attacked, and let it happen. One of their \"proofs\" was that the US carriers were out of port during the attack, and \"everybody knew\" carriers were the capital ship of the future.  However, the two carriers operating out of Pearl at the moment were sent West with light escort, on possibly intersecting routes with the IJN Kido Butai, which had far more carriers and a far heavier escort. Even stranger, the USS Enterprise was scheduled to be at Pearl by Dec 6th, but got delayed by a storm.  Consequently, for the PH conspiracy theorists to believe that FDR kept the carriers out of harm's way, we not only have to grant FDR the full knowledge of Kido Butai's route of approach would not result in either USN carrier fleet getting caught in a hopeless battle, but that FDR could psychically manipulate the weather to prevent Halsey from sailing into Pearl and thus be ambushed.  To make a very long story short, it is foolish to assume that the US wanted to go to war against Japan prior to 1941, considering the weight of evidence arguing against a US desire for war, and the overwhelming lack of evidence (not to mention rational thought) arguing for a US desire for war. --     mtfes...@netMAPSONscape.net Fri , 28 Jan 2005 17:08:52 + 0000 ( UTC ) Re : U.S. provoked Japan ?",
